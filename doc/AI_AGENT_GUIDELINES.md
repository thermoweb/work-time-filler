# AI Agent Context Template

This file contains instructions for AI agents working on the WTF TUI project.

## Required Reading

**Before making any code changes, AI agents MUST:**
1. Read and follow `doc/BEST_PRACTICES.md`
2. Understand the patterns already in use in similar code
3. Propose changes that align with existing conventions

## Agent Behavior Guidelines

- **Read before writing**: Always check `doc/BEST_PRACTICES.md` before generating or modifying code
- **Consistency first**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase unless there's a documented reason to deviate
- **Small changes**: Prefer surgical, minimal modifications over large refactors
- **Document rationale**: Explain why changes follow (or deviate from) best practices

## Updating Best Practices

- AI agents should NOT directly modify `doc/BEST_PRACTICES.md`
- Instead, suggest additions/changes in PR descriptions or comments
- Human maintainers will review and update the best practices file

### Integration Points

This template should be referenced in:
- Project README (for human developers)
- CI/CD documentation
- Code review checklists
